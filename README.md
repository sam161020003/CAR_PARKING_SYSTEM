Car Safety Parking System
Overview
The Car Safety Parking System is an IoT-enabled project designed to enhance parking safety. The system leverages ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles and provides real-time feedback to the driver, thereby preventing potential collisions.

Features
Obstacle Detection: Uses ultrasonic sensors to measure distance from nearby objects.
Real-Time Feedback: Displays warnings and proximity details on an LCD screen.
Modular Design: Integrates components such as Arduino Mega, NodeMCU, and LCD display for efficient operation.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple hardware setup with clear indicators.
Technologies and Components
Microcontroller: Arduino Mega 2560
Sensors: Ultrasonic sensors for obstacle detection
Communication Module: NodeMCU for Wi-Fi integration
Display: LCD screen for real-time feedback
Additional Components: Buzzer, LEDs, and power regulators
How It Works
The ultrasonic sensors measure the distance between the car and obstacles.
Data is processed by the Arduino Mega, which determines the proximity level.
Feedback is displayed on the LCD screen, with audio signals from the buzzer for immediate alerts.
Installation and Setup
Connect the ultrasonic sensors to the Arduino Mega as per the circuit diagram.
Configure the NodeMCU for wireless communication.
Compile and upload the Arduino code using the Arduino IDE.
Power the system and test with different distances to verify accuracy.
Future Enhancements
Integration with smartphone apps for remote monitoring.
Advanced features such as automatic braking systems.
